# Cubes 3D
Cubes 3D is still in development and all information will be subject to change.

## Development
Cubes 3D is developed with Unity 2017.1.

## Controls for keyboard and mouse
When in the main game screen, you can move the character using WASD or arrow keys. You can also pan the camera and rotate the player using the mouse. The mousewheel can be used to zoom the camera in and out.

Using Escape, you can pause the game and open the pause menu. There you can return to the main menu.

Some objects can be picked up (for example the red stick) with E. Held items may be dropped in front of the character by tapping Q. To throw any object your character holds, hold Q and let go, when the flying arc reached, where you want to throw.

Currently our character can only hold one item at the time. So in order to pick up something different you will have to drop, what you are holding.

If your character holds a weapon (for example the red stick) you may use it by clicking the left mouse button.

## Controls for Controllers
Controllers for PCs are extremely diverse an come in numerous shapes. It is very tricky to provide users with a keybinding, that works for everyone, so you will have to configure the bindings yourself in the Unity game launcher.

Used keybindings are:
- Fire 1: use current weapon
- Fire 2: pick up nearby object
- Fire 3: drop/throw held item
- Horizontal and Vertical axis: character movement

We currently do not support zooming (as with the mousewheel) with controllers.
